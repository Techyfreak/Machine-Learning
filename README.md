# Machine-Learning



## Introduction to Machine Learning<br />

##### We may not know how ML really works, but we are the consistent users of it.<br />
 
                 
> Have you ever wondered, how youtube suggest videos of your interest! <br />
> Have you ever noticed that, amazon can successfully suggest the products that you really wish!<br />
> Have you ever surprised about the fact that ,google maps was able to show you down the shortest path of your destination!

Right from an application which is available in your play store to all the way to an advanced AI Bot,everything consist of  ML algorithms.<br />
So,Ladies and Gentlemen ,<br />
&emsp;&emsp;   Welcome to the world of Machine Learning!!!<br />
   
Most likely artificial intelligence is considered to be a black magic.But actually ,we have to sweat a lot to do this magic.<br />
So people,In which sector do you think AI and ML is most prominently used?<br />
If you say ,it is in health sector.Well, a big no to you.<br />
If you guess it out to be in banking sector.Once again its noOOOO !!<br />
Well AI is most prominently used in the marketing industry.Yes people,you heard it right!!<br />

Right from the ad's that you notice to Netflix's movie recommendation system,ML is exclusively  used to analyze your sentiment and
suggest their products based on your interests.<br />

## Now, What is Machine Learning?<br />

When I raised this same question to Mr Google,he was able to come up with the following statement <br />
&emsp;Machine learning is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods <br />
that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.<br />

Literally ,I was thrilled to here this from him,but sad part of this is that  I was'nt able to understand anything!! <br />
Well jokes apart,most of us tend to believe that machine learning is all about making the machines to learn.<br />
But once a genious said to me,Its all about learning the machines (learning the functions).<br />

In layman terms ,Just consider a function in which both the set of input and output is given(data) .<br />
If the function was successfully able to identify the pattern/relationship (the logic) residing in these data and if it was able to <br />
predict the output for the newly given input,<br />

## Difference between logic-driven programming and Machine Learning<br />

In logic- driven /classical programing ,logic will be framed by the programmer.<br />
Whereas in machine learning,the logic will be determined by the function from the set of datas given.<br /><br /><br />

## ML in Real World<br /><br />

Most of the unicorn companies around the world like Google,Facebook,Apple are driven by ML ath their core.<br />
Fintech(Financial + Technology) companies use Machine learning where Feedzai is the market leader in fighting fraud with AI.Fintech<br />
companies use AI for financial data analytics, customer service, supply chain management, trading advice, and much more. <br />

Match making websites use Machine Learning algorithm to predict who the person will marry.Social Media Platforms like LinkeIn ,Instagram also 
uses ML to predict the likely friends.If you are a frequent user of LinkedIn,try to recall that the app would suggest you with <br />
some recommended profiles to follow .<br />

Obviously there are lots and lots of ML applications that can be laid out.But still lot more to go!!!Yes,right!Im not going to 
conclude in a way as if how most of the AI enthusiasts used to...ML is the mot powerful tool and it will be ruling the world...BLAH!BLAH!BLAH!<br />
As said earlier, AI is just a tool.So before learning the skill of AI..Let us try to learn the wisdom of applying AI .<br />
Let's embrace this technology!!Let us learn this technology to change the world more positively with some wisdom!!<br />

#### Good day ppl!
